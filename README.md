Summary: 
  Temperature in Ohau is warm even in December with our analysis of query of temperatures. The information so far indicates to the investor that there is a good chance for sustained tourists to arrive at Ohau with sole intention of surfing. Also a ice-cream shop along with the surf shop will have continued sales given the surfers could feel tired and would not mind ice-creams towards late afternoons

  The two months cater to reasonably warm weather with a difference of 3.90 degree F, in their mean temperatures.

  This is quiet comforting statistics, which indicates to the investor that the chances of temperature dropping in December is very low, which will favor surfing and demand for ice creams from tourists. 

  Also, the December month indicates a higher standard deviation which implies that there are (69-56)/3.74 approximately 4 readings below 0.25 Quantile. 69 deg F is also a comfortable temperature to surf, given the water in Ohau will be warm.
